# Relation Type Determinator Web App

We have an upcoming test tomorrow... actually today! (I speedran its creation) To bolster my knowledge about our quiz, I created a web application that implements *some* functions that would determine whether a relation is reflexive, symmetric, or antisymmetric. I also included set transitivity.

## Disclaimer
I am not using it to cheat, though! Just a fun project to really check my knowledge. You can use it for your own purposes! [Live demo](https://codenamerey.github.io/relation-type-determinator)
